# Careibu Code Challenge

## Overview

This project is a web application built using **Node.js** for the backend server, **React** for the frontend, and **Firebase** for user authentication and database management. The application enables users to register, log in, and interact with the system, while all authentication and data management is handled through Firebase.

- **Frontend**: React provides a dynamic, component-driven UI with separate components for each page and buttons, for reusability.
- **Backend**: Node.js manages server-client interactions and communicates with Firebase for authentication and database operations.
- **Database**: Firebase is used for managing user authentication, registration, and storing data.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used to style the application and ensure responsiveness. Only basic minimum added at this moment. 

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Users can register and log in using their email and password via Firebase Authentication.
  - Displays generic error messages for failed login attempts.
  
- **Frontend with React**:
  - A registration and login page connected to Firebase Authentication.
  - React hooks manage user state and form inputs.
  - Tailwind CSS is used for a responsive and modern UI design.

- **Backend with Node.js**:
  - Node.js handles the server-side logic, including user authentication and validation via Firebase Admin SDK.
  - Communicates with the Firebase service to verify user credentials.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**:
  - Tailwind CSS is used for creating a flexible, mobile-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database & Authentication**: Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore/Realtime Database
- **Other Tools**: Axios (for API requests)
